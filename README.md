EdX - HarvardX: Data Science: Capstone - movie_lens_project

This project is an assessment, part of the online course "HarvardX: Data Science: Capstone" from Harvard University on Edx platform ("https://www.edx.org/learn/data-science/harvard-university-data-science-capstone"). 
The HarvardX: Data Science: Capstone" is the last part of a global "Professional Certificate Program in Data Science" from Harvard University on Edx platform ("https://pll.harvard.edu/series/professional-certificate-data-science")
The purpose of this project is to autonomously put into practice all the knowledge learned during the past courses. 
The documents in this project will be highly commented in order to facilitate its readability and evaluation.

In this project, the goal is to create a movie recommendation algorithm.
The algorithm will be tested on the "final_holdout_test" set and evaluated using the RMSE calculation method (the goal is an RMSE < 0.86490).
The data contains ratings from users of the online movie recommender service "MovieLens," and it is made available by GroupLens ("https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/").
You can find more information about the dataset here: "https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-10m-README.html".
